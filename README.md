# google-clone
This is Project 0 for Harvard's CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. I designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

This projects has met the following requirements:
Has at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (index.html), one for Google Image Search (image-search.html), and one for Google Advanced Search (advanced-search.html).
The Google Search page has links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there are links in the upper-right to return to Google Search.
On the Google Search page, users can type in a query, click “Google Search”, and then are taken to the Google search results for that page.
There is also an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button on the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
On the Google Image Search page, users are able to type in a query, click a search button, and are taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
On the Google Advanced Search page, users can provide input for the following four fields:
Find pages with… “all these words:”
Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
Find pages with… “any of these words:”
Find pages with… “none of these words:”
When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, users are taken to the search results page for their given query.
The CSS is consistent and resembles Google’s own aesthetics.
